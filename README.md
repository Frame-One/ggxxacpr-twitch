# FAQs
#### Are these matches live?
Yes.

#### Why is it broken?
Something went wrong, I will fix it when I can, sorry.

#### Why did the stream turn off?
I have to segment the vods or twitch will terminate the stream at 48 hours. The stream runs for 23 hours and 59 minutes then turns on again after a minute.

#### Why do matches disconnect?
I assume if the match cannot be downloaded before the players finish their session it ends, also genuine rage quits do happen but much rarer than the first case.

#### Can I use this footage?
Yes, just mention the channel name but if you forget it's ok.

#### That was very nice of you to buy a laptop and run it 24/7 just to stream this.
Thank you, I thought it would be cool.

#### Also what's with the resolution?
ACPR runs at 640x480. Because of this, you can integer scale the game to 1280x960 and 1920x1440. 1440p is a little too big for twitch bitrate limits so it's at 960p. If you're running ACPR on a 1440p monitor, set anti aliasing to OFF in settings for a very nice crisp image. Otherwise AA: 2X seems to be the best option. Also, if you're able to view this stream in a media player like VLC or MPV, it looks really, really good.

#### Can I support you for doing this?
Yes. Probably best off sending bits/subs to this channel or better yet twitch.tv/prospekt.

#### !steam
This command can be used when the "Signin changed" prompt is displayed, or if the game is on the title screen and NOT in attract mode.

this kills the game entirely and gets it back into spectating, useful if anything goes wrong that isn't covered by other commands.
