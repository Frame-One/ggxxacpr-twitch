# FAQs
#### Why is it broken?
Something went wrong, I will fix it when I can, sorry.

#### Why did the stream turn off?
I have to segment the vods or twitch will terminate the stream at 48 hours. The stream runs for 23 hours and 59 minutes then turns on again after a minute.

#### Why do matches disconnect?
I assume if the match cannot be downloaded before the players finish their session it ends, also genuine rage quits do happen but much rarer than the first case.

#### Can I use this footage?
Yes, just mention the channel name but if you forget it's ok.

#### That was very nice of you to buy a laptop and run it 24/7 just to stream this.
Thank you, I thought it would be cool.

#### Also what's with the resolution?
ACPR runs at 640x480. Because of this, you can integer scale the game to 1280x960 and 1920x1440. 1440p is a little too big for twitch bitrate limits so it's at 960p. If you're running ACPR on a 1440p monitor, set anti aliasing to OFF in settings for a very nice crisp image. Otherwise AA: 2X seems to be the best option. Also, if you're able to view this stream in a media player like VLC or MPV, it looks really, really good.

#### Can I support you for doing this?
Yes. Probably best off sending bits/subs to this channel or better yet twitch.tv/prospekt.
